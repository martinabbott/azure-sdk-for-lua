# azure-sdk-for-lua
Basic SDK for Azure written in Lua

This SDK is meant primarily to be used with the ComputerCraft mod in Minecraft.

As such it supports Lua 5.1

Why?

Because kids like Minecraft and Lua is a relatively easy language to learn so the intention is to provide a ways for parents to work with their kids on cool projects together.
